## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Through this exercise i have been able to perfect my use of css flexbox and to efficiently deliver a responsive web design template.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class= "container"> 
</div>
```
```css
.container {
      display: flex;
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to learn JavaScript in other to bring more functionalities into my work.web framewoks like React, Angular and Bootstrap, will be learnt.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me generally, in HTML and CSS.
- [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me when i developed issues. Issues such as Image coming out of its div and things like that.
